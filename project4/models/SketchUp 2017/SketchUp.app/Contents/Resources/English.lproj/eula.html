<h1>SOFTWARE END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT (Trimble SketchUp)</h1>
<hr>

<p><b>IMPORTANT, READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.</b> BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING OR USING ALL OR ANY PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE, YOU ARE ACCEPTING ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. YOU AGREE THAT THIS AGREEMENT IS ENFORCEABLE LIKE ANY WRITTEN AGREEMENT.</p>
<p>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SOFTWARE. IF YOU HAVE PAID A LICENSE FEE FOR USE OF THE SOFTWARE AND DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY RETURN THE SOFTWARE FOR A FULL REFUND, PROVIDED YOU (A) DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE AND (B) RETURN THE SOFTWARE WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OF YOUR INITIAL PURCHASE.</p>
<p>BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE 18 YEARS OLD OR OLDER AND CAPABLE OF ENTERING INTO A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT.</p>
<p>IF YOU WISH TO USE THE SOFTWARE AS AN EMPLOYEE, CONTRACTOR, OR AGENT OF A CORPORATION, PARTNERSHIP OR SIMILAR ENTITY, THEN YOU MUST BE AUTHORIZED TO SIGN FOR AND BIND THE ENTITY IN ORDER TO ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. THE LICENSES GRANTED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT ARE EXPRESSLY CONDITIONED UPON ACCEPTANCE BY SUCH AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL.</p>
<p><i>If an executed agreement exists between you and Trimble at any time regarding the Software, the terms of that agreement shall supersede the terms of this Agreement in its entirety. Thus, if you enter into a separate written agreement with Trimble regarding the Software, that agreement (not this one) will control your use of the Software; and further if that agreement is terminated, you will not have the right to use the Software under the terms of this Agreement after termination.</i></p>
<p>This Software End User License Agreement (<b>"Agreement"</b>) is between Trimble Inc., located at <span class="dnt">935 Stewart Drive, Sunnyvale, CA 94085 USA</span>, or the affiliate identified on the Order Form, and its affiliates (<b>"Trimble"</b>) and the customer (individual or entity) that has downloaded or otherwise procured the licensed Software (as defined below) for use as an end user (<b>"you"</b>). This Agreement covers any Software and supporting user or technical documentation provided with the Software (<b>"Documentation"</b>).</p>

<h2>1. Definitions</h2>
<p><b>"Effective Date"</b> means the earlier of the date you sign an Order Form or the date on which the Software is first made available to you.</p>
<p><b>"Order Form"</b> means any order (which includes without limitation online orders) which is entered into by Trimble (or an authorized Trimble distributor or reseller) and you under which you are provided the Software. Each Order Form for the Software shall be deemed a part of this Agreement. This Agreement is binding on you whether or not you executed an Order Form with Trimble. Order Forms may not vary the terms of this Agreement. Only a written agreement, signed by Trimble (not a Trimble Supplier) may vary the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<p><b>"Trimble Content"</b> means 3D models, Style files, templates, and other similar materials and content owned by or licensed to Trimble and/or its affiliates whether or not proprietary, which are made available to you through the Software. Trimble Content does not include Google Content (as defined in Section 13.12).</p>

"Software" shall also include any releases provided to or purchased by you under any separate support and maintenance agreement you may enter into with Trimble. Unless otherwise noted, the Software, Trimble Content and Documentation are referred to collectively herein as "Software."</p>
<p><b>"Third-Party Software"</b> means any third-party software that is provided to you by Trimble under separate terms and conditions.</p>

<h2>2. License</h2>
<h3>2.1. Grant of License</h3>
<p>Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Trimble grants you a non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use the Software in machine-readable form on any computer and operating system for which it was intended, but solely: (a) in accordance with the Documentation; and (b) in accordance with any additional license term, subscription term or other user, seat, computer, field of use or other restrictions set forth in the applicable Order Form or otherwise specified upon purchase. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Trimble grants you a non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive license to input, upload, download, reproduce, adapt, make derivative works based on, publicly perform and display, and modify the Trimble Content available through the Software in connection with the normal course of the operation of such Software.</p>
<h3>2.2. Special License Terms</h3>
<h4>2.2.1. SketchUp Make</h4>
<p>SketchUp Make Software is licensed only for non-commercial use for your internal business purposes. Non-commercial use means that you may not sell, rent, or lease the output of the Software. Any other use requires the purchase of a SketchUp Pro license. For example, if you are a for-profit organization of any kind, or an employee of a for-profit organization using the Software in that capacity, you are engaged in commercial activity; therefore, in order to use the Software, you must purchase a SketchUp Pro license. Government agencies are considered to be commercial users and must purchase a SketchUp Pro license.</p>
<h4>2.2.2. SketchUp Pro, SketchUp Viewer</h4>
<p>SketchUp Pro and SketchUp Viewer Software may be used for commercial purposes in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>
<h3>2.3. Installation</h3>
<p>Trimble may make available the Software and Documentation by disk or other media, or for download in electronic form. Trimble shall also provide you with electronic passwords or other enabling mechanisms if necessary to permit the licensed usage of the Software. All licenses shall commence, and delivery shall be deemed to occur, as of the Effective Date (or, if later, such date on which the Software and license keys are first made available to you). If your Order Form is with a Trimble Supplier, that Trimble Supplier (and not Trimble) is solely responsible for delivery to you and Trimble has no liability for any failure to deliver. If the Software requires license keys to operate as licensed to you, Trimble or the applicable Trimble Supplier will deliver such license keys to you.</p>
<h3>2.4. Software Intended to be Installed on Computers</h3>
<p>You may copy and install on your computers for use only by your employees the number of copies of the Software for which you have paid the applicable license fee. You may transfer the Software from one computer to another computer provided that the Software is completely removed and de-installed from the prior computer. You may also make a reasonable number of copies of the Software for back-up and archival purposes.</p>
<h3>2.5. License Restrictions</h3>
<p>You shall not (and shall not allow any third party to): (a) decompile, disassemble, or otherwise reverse engineer the Software or attempt to reconstruct or discover any source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats or programming interfaces of the Software by any means whatsoever (except and only to the extent that applicable law prohibits or restricts reverse engineering restrictions); (b) distribute, sell, sublicense, rent, lease, or use the Software (or any portion thereof) for time sharing, hosting, service provider, or like purposes; (c) remove any product identification, proprietary, copyright, or other notices contained in the Software; (d) copy (except as expressly permitted in this Agreement), modify or translate any part of the Software, create a derivative work of any part of the Software, or incorporate the Software into or with other software, except to the extent expressly authorized in writing by Trimble; (e) attempt to circumvent or disable the security key mechanism that protects the Software against unauthorized use (except and only to the extent that applicable law prohibits or restricts such restrictions); (f) publicly disseminate performance information or analysis (including, without limitation, benchmarks) from any source relating to the Software.; or (g) use or host the Software in a virtual server environment.</p>

<p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you may choose to download SketchUp Make or SketchUp Pro for a trial period for 30 days from the date the Software is first run (unless otherwise agreed by Trimble in writing) (the <b>"Trial Period"</b>). SketchUp Pro consists of functionality available in SketchUp Make as well as functionality available only in SketchUp Pro.</p>
<h4>2.6.1 SketchUp Make</h4>
<p>If you choose to download SketchUp Make for a Trial Period, you will also be given access to SketchUp Pro functionality for the Trial Period for your evaluation purposes. Upon expiration of the Trial Period, the Software will automatically revert to SketchUp Make functionality only and the additional SketchUp Pro functionality will become inoperable.</p>
<h4>2.6.2 SketchUp Pro</h4>
<p>If you choose to download SketchUp Pro for a Trial Period, SketchUp Pro may be made available to you without charge for the Trial Period for your evaluation purposes of its functionality. The time remaining during the trial will be displayed within the Software. Upon the expiration of the Trial Period, the Software will automatically cease to operate.</p>
<h3>2.7. Educational Versions</h3>
<p>If you are a qualified instructor at an accredited educational institution, or you are an enrolled student at an accredited educational institution and use the Software in your classwork, you may use the Software for classroom teaching purposes, and classwork purposes (<b>"Educational Version"</b>). This includes installation and use of the Software in teaching labs at an educational institution, provided that use of the Software is by enrolled students who are engaged in classroom learning activities at the educational institution. However, if you are an employee of an educational institution and your job responsibilities are not those of a qualified instructor, you must purchase a SketchUp Pro commercial license. Educational Versions of the Software are for educational purposes only and may not be used for commercial, professional or other for-profit purposes. For example, but not as a limitation, if you are employed as a member of the professional staff of an educational institution such as the facilities management team, you are considered to be engaged in for-profit activity and you must purchase a SketchUp Pro commercial license. In addition, other terms and conditions may apply to Educational Versions including without limitation, screening or author criteria as may be set by Trimble from time-to-time. Please contact Trimble for additional information. Educational Versions are licensed for a one year term unless specified otherwise in the Order Form. Upon expiration of the one year term, your right and license to use the Educational Version of the Software expires and the Software will automatically become inoperable. Qualified instructors, students and institutions may purchase a license for an Educational Version of the Software annually upon meeting all program requirements described in this section.</p>
<h3>2.8. 3D Warehouse and Extension Warehouse</h3>

<h2>6. Term of Agreement</h2>
<h3>6.1. Term</h3>
<p>This Agreement is effective as of the Effective Date and expires at such time as all license and subscriptions hereunder have expired in accordance with their own terms (the <b>"Term"</b>). You may also terminate this Agreement at any time by permanently deleting the Software in its entirety. Either party may terminate this Agreement (including all related Order Forms) if the other party: (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement within thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors arrangement, composition or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against such party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days). If you have entered into a separate written agreement with Trimble which governs the Software and that agreement is terminated, then this Agreement automatically terminates and you shall no longer have any right to use the Software. Termination is not an exclusive remedy and the exercise by either party of any remedy under this Agreement will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under this Agreement, by law, or otherwise.

The Photo Textures feature provides access to certain Google-owned Street View imagery, which has been licensed by Google to Trimble, to enable creation of photo-textured models (the <b>"Street View Content"</b>). Trimble grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non- exclusive sublicense to use, reproduce, modify, publicly perform and publicly display, and create derivative works of the Street View Content as embodied in a model created with the Photo Textures feature (a <b>"Photo Textures Model"</b>). You may not disassociate or separate the Street View Content from the Photo Textures Model. Without Trimble or Google's prior written authorization, you may not use or distribute a Photo Textures Model in a mapping or geographic application or service (other than a Google owned and operated service, such as Google Earth).</p>
