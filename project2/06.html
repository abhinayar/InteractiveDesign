		<div>i want to apologize
		<br/>to all the women i have called
		<br/><em>pretty.</em>
		<br/>before i've called them
		<br/><strong>intelligent</strong>
		or
		<br/><strong>brave.</strong>
		</div>
		<div>
		<h3>i am sorry</h3>
		</div>
		<div>
		i made it sound as though
		<br/>something as <em>simple</em> as what you're born with
		<br/>is the <strong>most</strong> you have to be proud of
		</div>
		<br/>
		<div>
		when your spirit has
		<br/>crushed <em>mountains</em>
		</div>
		<br/>
		<div>
		from now on i will say things like,
		<br/>you are <strong>resilient</strong> or,
		<br/>you are <strong>extraordinary.</strong>
		</div>
		<br/>
		<div>
		<strong>not</strong>
		<br/>because i <em>don't</em> think you're pretty.
		<br/><strong>but</strong>
		<br/>because you are <em>so much more than that</em>
		</div>
