		<p>i want to apologize to all the women</p>
		<p>i have called pretty.</p>
		<p>before i've called them intelligent or brave.</p>
		<p>i am sorry i made it sound as though</p>
		<p>something as simple as what you're born with</p>
		<p>is the most you have to be proud of</p>
		<p>when your spirit has crushed mountains</p>
		<p>from now on i will say things like, you are resilient</p>
		<p>or, you are extraordinary.</p>
		<p>not because i don't think you're pretty.</p>
		<p>but because you are so much more than that</p>
