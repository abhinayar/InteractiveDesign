		<p>i want to apologize to all 
		<br/>the women i have called pretty.
		<br/>before i've called them intelligent<br/>or brave.</p>
		<p>i am sorry</p>
		<p>i made it sound as though<br/>something as simple<br/>as what you're born with is the<br/>most<br/>you have to be proud of
		<br/>when your spirit<br/>has crushed<br/>mountains</p>
		<p>from now on i will say things like,<br/>you are resilient or,<br/>you are extraordinary.
		<br/>not<br/>because i don't think you're pretty.
		<br/>but<br/>because you are so much more than that</p>
