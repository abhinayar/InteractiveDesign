        i want to apologize to all the women i have called beautiful
        before i've called them intelligent or brave
    </div>
    <div class="middle section">
        i am sorry i made it sound as though
        something as simple as what you're born with
        is all you have to be proud of
        when you have broken mountains with your wit 
    </div>
    <div class="right section">
        from now on i will say things like
        you are resilient, or you are extraordinary
        not because i don't think you're beautiful
        but because i need you to know
        <span class="bottom">you are more than that</span>
