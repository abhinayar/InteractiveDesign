		<div><strong>i want to apologize
		<br/>to all the women i have called
		<br/></strong><em>pretty.</em><strong>
		<br/>before i've called them
		<br/></strong>intelligent<strong>
		or
		<br/></strong>brave.
		</div>
		<br/>
		<div>
		i am sorry
		</div>
		<br/>
		<div>
		<strong>i made it sound as though
		<br/>something as </strong><em>simple</em> <strong>as what you're born with
		<br/>is the </strong>most<strong> you have to be proud of</strong>
		</div>
		<br/>
		<div>
		<strong>when your spirit has
		<br/>crushed </strong><em>mountains</em>
		</div>
		<br/>
		<div>
		<strong>from now on i will say things like,
		<br/>you are </strong>resilient <strong>or,
		<br/>you are </strong>extraordinary.
		</div>
		<br/>
		<div>
		not
		<br/><strong>because i </strong><em>don't</em><strong> think you're pretty.</strong>
		<br/>but
		<br/><strong>because you are </strong><em>so much more than that</em>
